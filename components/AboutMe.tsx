                    Hello, my name is Sahed Moral.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I hail from Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I spent my early years,
                    received my education at Baghoon High School and Kaligonj Sramik College,
                    and later pursued my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Dhaka International University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a deep curiosity for a wide range of subjects, although formal education hasn't always been my strong suit.
                    My passion lies in computers and technology, with a particular fondness for computer programming.
                    Lately, I've developed a keen interest in cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spending time with my friends is something I cherish. In the past, I used to frequent Koratkol University, which I considered the ultimate hangout spot. Unfortunately, I can no longer do so since I relocated from Bangladesh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm employed as a remote senior web application developer at Inmagine Lab. Additionally, I serve as an administrator for phpXperts, Bangladesh's largest developer community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lately, I've developed a newfound passion for cooking, and I'm excited to share my recipes here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wear my Bangladeshi ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡© identity with great pride.
