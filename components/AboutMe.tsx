                    Hello, my name is Sahed Moral.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I hail from Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I spent my early years,
                    received my education at Baghoon High School and Kaligonj Sramik College,
                    and later pursued my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Dhaka International
                    University.

                    I have a deep curiosity for a wide range of subjects, although formal education hasn't always been
                    my strong suit.
                    My passion lies in computers and technology, with a particular fondness for computer programming.
                    {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
                    Lately, I've developed a keen interest in cars.

                    Playing Cricket with my friends is something I cherish. In the past, I used to play as a pace bowler.

                    Currently, I'm employed as a remote senior web application developer at Inmagine Lab. Additionally,
                    {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
                    I serve as an administrator for phpXperts, Bangladesh's largest developer community.

                    Lately, I've developed a newfound passion for cooking, and I'm excited to share my recipes here.
